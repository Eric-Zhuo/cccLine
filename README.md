**T** method, a linear algorithm for central catadioptric camera calibration based on the properties of the common self-polar triangle between the line image and mirror contour to recover intrinsic and mirror parameters. 

## What is this ?

A m-file which implements the **T** method for the review version.

## How does it work ?

The method is described in the submitted article. 
To use it, just download them and execute [main.m](./main.m) on your m-file interpreter.
